        <h2>Get To Know More About Moon</h2>
        <p>The Moon plays a powerful part in our lives in multiple ways.
            Given we are all personally influenced by the Moon's energy 
            every day, the urge to show our gratitude for (and fascination
             with) her romantic beauty by posting Moon quotes on Instagram 
             or in text to those we love is as naturally compelling as the 
             pull of the Moon itself.Much of the Moon's beauty lies in the 
             way it remains deeply mysterious while shining a light on that 
             which surrounds us, serving as a guiding light in the darkness 
             while leaving the potential for growth and whatever else we might 
             do with it in our hands. 
            
              The moon symbolizes feminity, ruling our emotions through the
              rhythmic nature of its cycles and inspiraing us to into the world
              and rediscovering Mother Nature. The Moon's cycles themselves — 
              New Moon, Crescent Moon, Quarter Moon, Gibbous Moon, Full Moon and 
              back around again — are said to represent immortality and enlightenment.

              In astrology, the Moon has a strong influence on all zodiac signs and placements. <br><br>
              The lunar position in your birth chart plays a large role in shaping who you are and 
              how you process your emotions. Additionally, the Moon's placement at any given moment 
              can shine a light on certain predicaments we may not be seeing clearly.

              Spritually, the Moon represents your inner world. Whereas the Sun shapes your outward 
              identity and personality, the Moon guides your unconscious feelings and desires.<br><br> 
              New Moon and Full Moon rituals allow you to harness the Moon's energy in ways that will 
              enhance your life and spirit.

              New Moons are believed to be the ideal time for setting intentions for manifestation, 
              while Full Moons are meant for reflecting on, receiving and expressing gratitude for 
              those manifestations you set in motion during earlier phases. <br><br> </p>
